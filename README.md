## Description

A work scheduler implented using html, css, javascript and 3rd party APIs. This application was made with the intetion of not only demonstrating how far my skills have improved but also help users who need help keeping track of their daily tasks. This scheduler keeps track of user submitted events and keeps track of the current time to let the user know if they're on time, early, or behind on their schedule so they can adjust their plans accordingly.

The user may write their tasks for their day inside the blocks and click on the save button found on the very right of the time slot to save their events to local storage so they may persist even after the page is reloaded. The user may also overwrite current existing event by deleting exisisting events and writing a new event, then clicking the save button. The time slots willchange color depending on the tim period. Slots will be the color green if its still not the time shown on the slot. They will turn red once the time matches the current time and they will be set to grey once the marked time has passed.
